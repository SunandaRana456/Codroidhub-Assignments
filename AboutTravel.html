We create custom tours tailored to your dates, interests, preferences, and budget. We offer a premium service with hand-picked hotels, drivers, and guides to ensure you avoid the potential challenges of travel in India, and have a smooth, hassle-free trip. We will pick you up at the airport, help you get a local SIM card, and make sure we are available 24/7 via telephone/WhatsApp in case of any problem during your trip. Ensuring women travellers in India are safe and comfortable is our number one goal.<br><br> 

India for Beginners is a partnership between Mariellen Ward, an India-based traveller who knows what it’s like to travel as a foreign woman in India, and a local, Delhi-based travel company with many years of knowledge and experience, plus a nation-wide network of contacts. Our clients get the best of both worlds — the foreigner perspective and local expertise.<br><br> 

We also partner with very special, hand-picked companies run by thoughtful, dedicated people who support responsible tourism, sustainability, local communities, and women empowerment.</font></font></font></p>
