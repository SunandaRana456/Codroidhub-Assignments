                <h2>Welcome to the India for Beginners Travel Blog</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s been a while since I started a new travel blog. Some long-time followers may know, I started travel blogging in India in 2005 – which makes me one of the very first travel bloggers. This was at the very beginning of travel blogging, and very early days of social media. It was just a casual blog on a shared platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, I got serious about both travel in India and travel blogging, and started blogging professionally in 2009 with the launch of Breathedreamgo. As I kept travelling in India, blogging, and dispensing travel advice … I finally decided to do two things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move to India.</li>
                    <li>Start a tour company.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Helping people get the most out of their trip to India is our motivation and our reward. We love sharing our insider knowledge about the best places to stay, the shortest travel routes, the sights you shouldn’t miss, the dishes you have to try, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    India for Beginners custom tours are especially designed for solo female travellers, first-time visitors to India, and people with a “beginner’s mind” who want to see India in a new way, with a focus on sustainability and authenticity.
