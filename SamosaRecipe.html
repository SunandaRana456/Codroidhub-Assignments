        <p align="left"><font color="212121"><font size="5"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Samosa is a crispy, golden-fried North Indian snack with a flaky pastry shell filled with a savory, spiced, tangy mixture of mashed potatoes, green peas, and aromatic spices. This iconic street food is often served hot with sweet tamarind and spicy green chutneys, making it a beloved tea-time treat across Delhi, Punjab, and beyond.

                <li> The first step is to cook the potatoes and peas for the savory and spiced filling.</li> <br><br>
                <li>For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker. <br><br>
                    
                    Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are cooked well.</li> <br><br>
                    <li>Next, roast or toast the spices. This will help to release their flavors and should not be skipped! <br><br>

To a small frying pan over low heat add the following spices: <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>½ inch cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>1 clove, optional</li>
    <li>1 green cardamom</li>
    <li>3 black peppercorns</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons coriander seeds</li> <br><br>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Then, put them in a spice grinder or small mixer-grinder jar. <br><br>

</li>
<li>Grind the toasted spices to a semi-fine powder, and set aside.</li> <br><br>
<li>Peel the skin off of the cooked potatoes, and chop them in ½ to 1 inch cubes. <br><br>
</li>
<li>In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil becomes medium hot then reduce the heat to low. <br><br>

Crackle ½ teaspoon cumin seeds until fragrant. I used mustard oil as it really adds a punch in the stuffing.</li> <br><br>
<li> Keep the heat on low and add 1 teaspoon finely chopped or minced ginger and 2 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies. <br><br>

Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.</li> <br><br>
<li> Now either switch off the heat or reduce it to low, then add: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Cooked green peas</li>
<li>½ teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
<li>1 pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
<li>The prepared dry spice mix</li>
<li>1 to 2 teaspoons dry mango powder (amchur)</li>
</ul>
</li> <br><br>
<li> Next add potato cubes, salt as required and 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) to the skillet.</li> <br><br>
<li>Mix very well and sauté for a minute. Check the taste, and add more of the spices, salt or dry mango powder if needed.  <br><br>

Cover and set the filling aside while you make the dough.</li> <br><br>
<li> In a large mixing bowl combine 2 cups all-purpose flour (250 grams), 1 teaspoon carom seeds, 1 teaspoon salt and 6 tablespoons ghee (50 grams).</li> <br><br>
<li>With your fingers, mix the ingredients together until they make a breadcrumb-like texture that holds its shape when you press a portion of the mixture.</li> <br><br>
<li> Then, working just a bit at a time, add in 7 to 8 tablespoons water in parts and knead. <br><br>

You can add 1 to 2 tablespoons extra water if needed if the dough looks floury or dry.</li> <br><br>
<li>Continue kneading to form a firm, tight dough. It should not be soft or sticky. Cover the dough with a moist kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.</li> <br><br>
<li>After the dough has rested, divide it into 6 to 7 even pieces. Take each piece and gently roll in your palms first to smooth and soften. Place it on your work surface or on the rolling board.

</li> <br><br>
<li>Then roll it with a rolling pin, being mindful to keep the thickness even at 1 mm and not too thin. 

</li> <br><br>
<li>Cut the with a knife or a pastry cutter, right through the center of the rolled pastry dough. 

</li> <br><br>
<li>e a rolling pin to gently flatten the half moon shape to make even. 

</li> <br><br>
<li> Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the dough with water around all of the edges.

</li> <br><br>
<li> Next, fold to join the straight edged side together to form a cone, like shown in the photo below. Be sure to press the edges well so that they are sealed! <br><br>

The cone is now ready to be stuffed with the potato and pea filling.</li> <br><br>
<li>Carefully spoon and lightly pack the prepared potato and pea stuffing into the cone.</li> <br><br>
<li> Crimp and pinch the edges to close as shown in photo below. This helps the samosa to stand once made.</li> <br><br>
<li>Evenly press all of the edges, making sure there are no cracks in the dough. The edges should be sealed very well so that the stuffing does not come out while frying.</li> <br><br>
<li> Heat the oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Test the oil by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly if the oil is hot enough for frying.</li> <br><br>
<li> Fry them on low to medium-low heat, keeping an eye on them so they don’t burn.</li>
<li>Fry until each aloo samosa is crisp and golden. The oil will stop sizzling once the samosas are fried well. They will become nicely crisp and golden.</li> <br><br>
<li>Use a skimmer spoon or spider spoon to carefully remove fried samosa from the oil, and place them on paper towels to remove extra oil.</li> <br><br>
<li> Serve Punjabi Samosa hot or warm or at room temperature with Coriander Chutney or Tamarind Chutney, or with a zesty tomato ketchup.</li> <br><br>
