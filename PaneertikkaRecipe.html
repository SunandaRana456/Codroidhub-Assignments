    <p align="left"><font color="212121"><font size="5"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori starter and snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don’t have an oven – instead of grilling in oven, you can make Tandoori Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post I am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods.</font></font></font></p>

    <li>Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese): This is the main ingredient in the dish and it is important to use a good quality paneer. In fact, as with all my paneer recipes, I recommend using Homemade Paneer. This ensures freshness and avoids any hidden ingredients and preservatives found in store-bought paneer.</li><br><br>
    <li>Marinade: Homeade Hung Curd (Hung Yogurt) is used as the base of the marinade. You can even use Greek Yogurt. The ground spices are then added to balance out the sour yogurt taste and give a flavor kick to the dish.</li><br><br>

 <p align="left"><font color="212121"><font size="5"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><ol type="1">
    <li>First whisk 2.25 cups of thick curd or hung curd till smooth in a bowl or pan.</li><br><br>
    <li>Add all the spices and herbs including besan (gram flour) & salt.</li><br><br>
        <li>
            <ul>
 <li>4 tablespoon besan (gram flour)</li>
 <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
<li>½ teaspoon black pepper powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
<li>½ teaspoon caraway seeds (shahjeera)</li>
<li>½ teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dry mango powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
<li>¾ tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon regular salt or edible rock salt or add as required.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br><br>
    <li> Stir and mix well.</li><br><br>
    <li>Add the diced vegetables – 1 medium to large bell pepper/capsicum, 1 medium to large tomato and 1 medium to large onion. Also add 250 to 300 grams paneer slices.</li><br><br>
    <li>With your hands or spoon mix very well so that the marinade coats the paneer and veggies evenly.</li><br><br>
    <li> Cover the bowl and keep the marinade in the fridge for 45 minutes to 3 hours. You can also keep overnight. The below photo is of the marinated paneer and veggies after 1 hour.</li><br><br>
    <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non stick pan/tawa or a well seasoned cast iron skillet. Coat the paneer and veggies with the marinade and place them on the tawa.<br><br>

You can fry at a low heat or medium heat. I fried in 3 batches and overall used about 3 tbsp oil.<br><br>

Another way is to skewer the paneer, veggies and then fry them. I chose to fry them directly as they get fried evenly and the texture is better.</li><br><br>
<li> When one side gets browned, gently lift and turn over. The paneer cubes will get cooked faster than the veggies.<br><br>

So remember to remove the paneer cubes as soon as they are golden. You can char or brown the veggies more.<br><br>

For the vegetables, you have to make sure the marinade on them gets cooked. So lightly press them while cooking.<br><br>

If you want you can fry the paneer cubes first and then the marinated vegetables. Pan fry all till they become golden.</li><br><br>
<li>Remove paneer tikka on a plate. I have not removed them on paper tissues, as due to heat and moisture from the paneer cubes, they stick to the paper tissues.</li><br><br>
<li>While still hot, then skewer the fried paneer cubes and veggies on to a wooden skewer or toothpick.<br><br>

You can also have this paneer tikka straight away without skewering. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon chaat masala and ¾ teaspoon lemon juice on the paneer cubes while serving.</li><br><br>
<li>Arrange them in a serving plate and serve the paneer tikka hot or warm with onion lemon salad or mint chutney.<br><br>
