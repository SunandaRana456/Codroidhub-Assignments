                <li>Soak 1 cup heaped urad dal (200 grams husked and split black lentils) overnight or for at least 4 to 5 hours.</li><br><br>
                <li> Then add the drained and soaked lentils in your trusted blender or mixer-grinder.</li><br><br>
                <li> Add in the following spices and herbs:</li><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>½ teaspoon chopped green chilies or serrano/thai chillies</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon chopped ginger</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                    <li>1 pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
                    <li>salt as needed</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <li>Blend or grind adding ¼ cup to ½ cup water in parts to a smooth fluffy batter.<br><br>

Depending on the quality, age of lentils and soaking time the water amount can vary from ½ to ¾ cup. Keep in mind that the batter has a thick to medium-thick flowing consistency.</li><br><br>
<li>Take the ground batter in a bowl with a help of a silicon spatula. Then briskly and vigorously whip the batter for two to three minutes with a spoon, whisk or spatula.</li><br><br>
<li> Stir in 1 tablespoon raisins (chopped) and 12 to 15 cashews (chopped roughly). These are optional ingredients and you can skip them if you want.</li><br><br>
<li>Heat oil as needed for deep frying in a kadai (Indian wok) or pan. Heat oil on medium heat. The oil should reach a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees Celsius.</li><br><br>
<li>Once the oil has reached the correct heat or temperature, now you can either drop the batter carefully with your fingers (without touching the hot oil) or with a spoon in medium hot oil.</li><br><br>
<li>Let the bottom side become light golden and crisp. Then only turn these or they will break in the oil.</li><br><br>
<li> Flip again and for a couple of times more while frying. This ensures even cooking and you should see a uniform golden color all over.</li><br><br>
<li> Place the vada on paper towels. This way fry the remaining vada in batches using up the entire batter.</li><br><br>
<li> Wait for 2 to 3 minutes and while they are still hot, add the vada in water (at room temperature) and let them soak for 12 to 15 minutes. The vada will release some of the oil and absorb water increasing a bit in size with a color change.</li><br><br>
<li>Press each soaked vada between your palms to remove water. Gently press or else you might end up breaking them</li><br><br>
<li>Press all the soaked vada this way and keep them aside in a plate or you can arrange them in the bowl or tray that you will be serving dahi vada.</li><br><br>
<li> Beat 2.5 cups chilled curd (yogurt) until smooth. Check the taste of the curd before you assemble.</li><br><br>
<li>Keep your chutneys ready. </li><br><br>
<li> In a large serving bowl or a tray arrange the vada which you had set aside after squeezing the water.</li><br><br>
<li>Pour the beaten curd evenly all over the vada covering them completely.</li><br><br>
<li>Pour the green coriander chutney and sweet tamarind chutney as you like.</li><br><br>
